# chapter 9 notes

## planning and estimating

Planning and Estimating 
* before sarting to build software it is essention to plan the entire development effort in detail

* Planning continues druing development and the post delivery maintenance
    * Intial planning is not enough
    * planning must proceed throughout the projeCT
    * THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME THAT DETAILED PLANNING CAN TAKE PLACE IS AFTER The SPEFICFICATIONS ARE COMPLete

__Cost estimation__
* occur at
    * concept phase
    * requirements analysis
    * design phase
    * implementation phast
    * implementation and testing
__Cost Types__
    * internal cost- cost to the developer
        * Hardware support
        * software support
        * overhead (rent, utilities)
    * extenal cost- cost to the client
__Duration Estimation__
    * Setting a delivery date
    * Overestimating
        * avoiding overstimating 
    * underestimating
        * loses credibility when deliverign latE
        * Avoiding penalties in the contract when delivering late
__factors which help estimating__
* Difficulty of project
* Human factors
    * developer expirience 
    * Developer compatibility
    * Whether critical stff will remain through the entire project
    *
